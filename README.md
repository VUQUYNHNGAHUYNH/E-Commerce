# Ecommerce website with Tailwind CSS, React, Strapi, and Redux Toolkit

Tailwind CSS has been used extensively to design and style our website, ensuring a modern and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. React, a popular JavaScript library, has been used to build the dynamic components and functionality of our website, resulting in a fast and user-friendly experience.

Strapi, a headless CMS, has been integrated with our website to provide a robust backend that allows us to easily manage our products, orders, and customers. With Strapi, we can easily add, update, and remove products, as well as manage orders and customers.

Redux Toolkit has been used to manage the state of our application, ensuring that our data is consistent across all components and screens. With Redux Toolkit, we can easily manage our shopping cart and user information, providing a seamless and personalized experience for our customers.
